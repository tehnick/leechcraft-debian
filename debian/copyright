 Few files and directories are excluded from tarball:
 https://github.com/0xd34df00d/leechcraft/tree/master/src/plugins/lcftp/
 https://github.com/0xd34df00d/leechcraft/tree/master/src/plugins/cstp/resources/images/clients/*
 https://github.com/0xd34df00d/leechcraft/tree/master/src/plugins/advancednotifications/share/sounds/*
 https://github.com/0xd34df00d/leechcraft/tree/master/src/plugins/azoth/share/azoth/iconsets/clients/default/* (except file unknown.png)
 .
 See section get-orig-source in debian/rules file for details.
 .
 These files are deleted from tarball because they are non-free or with very
 questionable licenses. Special patches in debian/patches/ directory give
 possibility to build program without these files.
